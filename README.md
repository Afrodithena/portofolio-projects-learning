# Hi, I'm Kinaya 👋

I’m an undergraduate statistics student learning data analysis, machine learning, and Python through hands-on projects.

This GitHub documents my learning journey, ranging from exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling to machine learning and early deep learning experiments.

Most repositories here are learning-focused and evolve over time as my skills improve, making them beginner-friendly and open for others to learn from as well.

### What I'm working on
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA), data handling, and visualization  
- Statistical modeling and analysis using Python and R  
- Machine learning and introductory deep learning concepts  
- Data visualization using Tableau and Power BI  
- SQL fundamentals for data analysis
