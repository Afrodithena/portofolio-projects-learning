## About Me
**Kinaya** — Undergraduate Statistics student with a strong interest in **Data Science** and **AI Engineering**.  
I bridge statistical thinking with software engineering best practices to build **production-ready AI systems**.

Currently focused on:
- **ML/NLP systems** with production-level code (OOP, type hints, logging)
- **LLM literacy** — RAG, evaluation, and prompt engineering
- **Engineering fundamentals** — API (FastAPI), container (Docker), version control (Git)
- **Dashboard engineering** — Looker Studio, SQL optimization
