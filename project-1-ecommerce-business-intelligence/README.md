## Development Roadmap
---
This project is developed in **6 sequential phases**, each focusing on different skills:

| Phase | Focus | Tech Stack | Status |
|------|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | **Foundation** | Python OOP, Logging, Type Hints | 🟡 In Progress |
| 2 | **Customer Churn** | Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Feature Engineering | 🟡 In Progress |
| 3 | **Pricing & Bundling** | Market Basket Analysis, Price Elasticity | 🟡 In Progress |
| 4 | **Delivery Analytics** | PostgreSQL, SQL (Window Functions, CTEs) | 🟡 In Progress |
| 5 | **Dashboard** | Looker Studio / Streamlit | 🟡 In Progress |
| 6 | **Portal + RAG** | LangChain, LLM, Vector DB | 🟡 In Progress |

- **Customer**: Segmentation & churn prediction for retention strategies
- **Operational**: Delivery bottlenecks by region & time
- **Product**: Frequently bought together items (bundling opportunities)
- **Personalization**: Automated retention messages using RAG
